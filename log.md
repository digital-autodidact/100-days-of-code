<h2 align="center"> Day 1: Wednesday, February 5, 2025</h2>

### **Today's Progress**: 
_I started my #100DaysOfCode challenge today. Here's what I did:_
- _Posted on Twitter to publicly commit myself to the challenge_
- _Started working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. Completed 17 HTML exercises!_
- _Created goal in Beeminder for an extra dose of accountability._

### **Thoughts & Feelings**: 
_I feel a mix of excitement and nervous energy today. I'm pleased with myself because I started as I promised I would today, so good job me! At the same time, I feel a low level of fear, because I'm wondering: will I be able to sustain this level of coding activity throughout the challenge?_

_Only time will tell. For now, I'm resolved to continue tomorrow._

### **Post-Practice Review**:

1. **What concepts did you learn from your practice session today?**

Today I learned about basic HTML concepts. These were mainly HTML elements and attributes, plus how to make comments and how to properly nest elements within each other:
- `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags
- `<p>` tags
- `<img>` tags
- `<src>` attribute
- `<alt>` attribute
- void elements
   
2. **Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?**

_No mistakes yet, only because nearly all of of the concepts were familiar to me, since I've worked with HTML before. It was a nice refresher for my memory. I'll enjoy the easy work for now, because I know I'll make mistakes once I start getting exposed to material that's completely new to me! No worries, though, since making mistakes and troubleshooting them is a natural part of the learning process._

3. **Are there any concepts you feel unsure about? Is there anything you want to research or do more drills on?**

_Not yet, no. See above for why._

6. **Did you use any tutorial resources outside of FreeCodeCamp?**

_Not yet, no._

### **Screenshots**:
No images today! I'll start to include screenshots in future log entries.

<h2 align="center"> Day 2: Thursday, February 6, 2025</h2>

### **Today's Progress**: 
I completed day 2 of the challenge! Here's what I did today:
- Continued working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. Completed 15 HTML exercises today (#17 → #32)

### **Thoughts & Feelings**: 
Doing the challenge was hard today, mainly because I kept pushing off starting until I noticed it was already 9PM. I shouldn't do that; leaving challenge to the last hour increases the likelihood I'll neglect to do it. Nevertheless, I did do the challenge today, so success! Good effort, Anthony. Let's keep going one more day.

### **Post-Practice Review**:

1. **What concepts did you learn from your practice session today?**

_Today, I learned about basic HTML elements again! Mainly these:_
- `<section>` element
- `<ul>` element
- `<ol>` element
- `<li>` element
- `<figure>` element
- `<figcaption>` element
- `<em>` element

2. **Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?**

_Yes, minor ones related to making typos. The main lesson derived? Be mindful of the details — I could easily see myself making this mistake again, especially if I'm coding when I'm mentally tired like I am today. It's another good reason to do the challenge in the morning or early afternoon, not the evening!_

3. **Are there any concepts you feel unsure about? Is there anything you want to research or do more drills on?**

_Hmm, not really. The only element that was unfamiliar to me were the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements, but they aren't hard concepts to grasp. I'm just commenting this to warn future me to be mindful. I feel that when I recreate this project on my own after I've read through all the exercises, I will be sufficiently competent with those two elements._

4. **Did you use any tutorial resources outside of FreeCodeCamp?**

_Not yet, no._
