### **Today's Progress**: 
I started my #100DaysOfCode challenge today. Here's what I did:
- Posted on Twitter to publicly commit myself to the challenge
- Started working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. Completed 17 HTML exercises!
- Created goal in Beeminder for an extra dose of accountability.

### **Thoughts & Feelings**: 
I feel a mix of excitement and nervous energy today. I'm pleased with myself because I started as I promised I would today, so good job me! At the same time, I feel a low level of fear, because I'm wondering: will I be able to sustain this level of coding activity throughout the challenge?

Only time will tell. For now, I'm resolved to continue tomorrow.

### **Post-Practice Review**:

1. What concepts did you learn from your practice session today?

Today I learned about basic HTML tags. Concepts like h1 tags, p tags, making comments, nesting, img tags, HTML attributes, void elements. 
   
2. Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?

No mistakes yet, only because nearly all of of the concepts were familiar to me, since I've worked with HTML before. It was a nice refresher for my memory. I'll enjoy the easy work for now, because I know I'll make mistakes once I start getting exposed to material that's completely new to me! No worries, though, since making mistakes and troubleshooting them is a natural part of the learning process.

3. Are there any concepts you feel unsure about? Is there anything you want to research or do more drills on?

Not yet, no. See above for why.

6. Did you use any tutorial resources outside of FreeCodeCamp?

Not yet, no.
