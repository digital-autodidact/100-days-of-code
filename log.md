# #100DaysOfCode Log






<h2 align="center"> Day 1: Wednesday, February 5, 2025</h2>

### **Today's Progress**: 
_I started my #100DaysOfCode challenge today. Here's what I did:_
- _Posted on Twitter to publicly commit myself to the challenge_
- _Started working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. Completed 17 HTML exercises!_
- _Created goal in Beeminder for an extra dose of accountability._

### **Thoughts & Feelings**: 
_I feel a mix of excitement and nervous energy today. I'm pleased with myself because I started as I promised I would today, so good job me! At the same time, I feel a low level of fear, because I'm wondering: will I be able to sustain this level of coding activity throughout the challenge?_

_Only time will tell. For now, I'm resolved to continue tomorrow._

### **Post-Practice Review**:

**1. What concepts did you learn from your practice session today?**

*Today I learned about basic HTML concepts. These were mainly HTML elements and attributes, plus how to make comments and how to properly nest elements within each other:*
- *`<h1>` and `<h2>` elements*
- *`<p>` element*
- *`<img>` element*
- *`<src>` attribute*
- *`<alt>` attribute*

*Additionally, I learned about the concept of a "void element". This is an element that has start tag but no end tag. An `<img>` element is an example of a void element.*
   
**2. Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?**

_No mistakes yet, only because nearly all of of the concepts were familiar to me, since I've worked with HTML before. It was a nice refresher for my memory. I'll enjoy the easy work for now, because I know I'll make mistakes once I start getting exposed to material that's completely new to me! No worries, though, since making mistakes and troubleshooting them is a natural part of the learning process._

**3. Are there any concepts you feel unsure about? Is there anything you want to research or do more drills on?**

_Not really, no. Only one concept was unfamiliar to me — the concept of a void element — but it was an easy concept to grasp._

**4. Did you use any tutorial resources outside of FreeCodeCamp?**

*Yes, I googled the term "void element" to find an alternative definition. I found this GeekForGeeks webpage: [Describe The Void Elements In HTML](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/describe-the-void-elements-in-html/)*

### **Screenshots**
*No images today! I'll start to include screenshots in future log entries.*

<h2 align="center"> Day 2: Thursday, February 6, 2025</h2>

### **Today's Progress**: 
*I completed day 2 of the challenge! Here's what I did today:*
- *Continued working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. Completed 15 HTML exercises today (#17 → #32)*

### **Thoughts & Feelings**: 
*Doing the challenge was hard today, mainly because I kept pushing off starting until I noticed it was already 9PM. I shouldn't do that; leaving challenge to the last hour increases the likelihood I'll neglect to do it. Nevertheless, I did do the challenge today, so success! Good effort, Anthony. Let's keep going one more day.*

### **Post-Practice Review**:

1. **What concepts did you learn from your practice session today?**

_Today, I learned more about basic HTML elements again! Mainly these:_
- *`<section>` element*
- *`<ul>` element*
- *`<ol>` element*
- *`<li>` element*
- *`<figure>` element*
- *`<figcaption>` element*
- *`<em>` element*

2. **Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?**

*Yes, minor ones related to making typos. The main lesson derived? Be mindful of the details — I could easily see myself making this mistake again, especially if I'm coding when I'm mentally tired like I am today. It's another good reason to do the challenge in the morning or early afternoon, not the evening!*

3. **Are there any concepts you feel unsure about? Is there anything you want to research or do more drills on?**

_Hmm, not really. The only element that was unfamiliar to me were the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements, but they aren't hard concepts to grasp. I'm just commenting this to warn future me to be mindful. I feel that when I recreate this project on my own after I've read through all the exercises, I will be sufficiently competent with those two elements._

4. **Did you use any tutorial resources outside of FreeCodeCamp?**

_Not yet, no._

<h2 align="center"> Day 3: Friday, February 7, 2025</h2>

### **Today's Progress**: 

*I completed day 3 of the challenge! Here's what I did today:*

- *Completed a 30 minute coding session! Started at 4:23 and ended at 4:53PM.*
- *Continued working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. Completed 11 HTML exercises today (#32 → #43)*

### **Thoughts & Feelings**: 

*Oof, today was a hard day, mentally. I woke up with in a mood that's best described as "scatterbrained". The initial enthusiam of starting the challenge evaporated, so I needed to apply some willpower to get myself going. I got it done, though.*

*I will revisit the reasons why I started this challenge; it'll be a good idea to recite aloud why I care about becoming a better programmer. I imagine this won't be the only time I feel my motivation take a dip.*

*For the record, it's okay for me to not feel ethusiastic, but that's no excuse for me to neglect doing what I promised I'd do! I will continue forward one more day.*


### **Post-Practice Review**:

**1. What concepts did you learn from your practice session today?**

*Today, I learned about and practiced with these HTML elements:*

- *`<section>` element*
- *`<strong>` element*
- *`<form>` element*
- *`action=""` attribute*
- *`input` element*
- *`type=""` attribute*
- *`name=""` attribute*
- *`placeholder=""` attribute*
- *`required` attribute*


**2. Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?**

*Yes, a couple syntax errors. All of them related to the input element, specifically, the attributes. Going forward, I need to be mindful to remember to include the `=""` syntax when using the `type`, `name`, `placeholder` attributes.*

**3. Are there any concepts you feel unsure about? Is there anything you want to research or do more drills on?**

*Yes, I feel uncertain about the `<form>` and `<input>` elements. Today was the first time I encountered them.*

*Apart from that, I identified a few confusion points today about concepts I'd previously seen. I turned them into questions, here they are for the record:*

- *What is an "element"?*
- *What is an "attribute"?*
- *What does it mean to "set a value" for an attribute?*

**4. Did you use any tutorial resources outside of FreeCodeCamp?**

*No, not today.*
