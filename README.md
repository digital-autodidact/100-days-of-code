# Anthony's #100DaysOfCode Challenge

*Hello curious visitor, welcome to my repo!*

In this README, you'll learn more about who I am, what I like to do, and why I do it. In doing so, I hope what you read resonates with you, so that one day we might collaborate and maybe even become friends!


## Who Am I?

*Hi, I'm Anthony! I'm committing myself to complete the #100DaysOfCode challenge.*

I'm a guy that likes to introduce himself as **"the Digital Autodidact"**! Why is that, you ask? Because I have an insatiable curiosity! I like to teach myself new skills for fun, and make stories about it online. What's the point of living, if not to be curious about the world and maybe learn something useful before our time on earth is up? Let's learn something together today 😄

Ultimately, my dream is to be **a Renaissance Man of the 21st century**! I intend to spend the rest of my life taking risks, learning from my mistakes, and building projects related to the subjects that fascinate my curiosity.







## What's this repo about?

*This repo is where I'll chronicle my quest to become a better programmer by completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge!*

My overall intention for the challenge to become a better web developer. Here are skills I intend to pursue:
- Become fluent with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Become fluent with Bootstrap, SASS and React
- Build a simple database using SQL
- Build a simple API
- Develop a positive reputation online as "the Digital Autodidact"
- Build a portfolio website to display my accomplishments



## Why am I doing this?

### (1) To promote autodidactism

> *"The mind is a beautiful thing to invest in and a terrible thing to waste"*

> *"I am always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught"*

Autodidactism is the practice of self-education. If you like etymology, the name has two parts: “auto”, meaning self, and “didactic”, which relates to teaching or instruction.

Put simply, autodidactism is when you learn a subject or skill independently, usually outside of formal learning institutions (such as K-12 education, or university). The key thing is not whether or not you learn in a classroom, but rather having the "autodidact mindset". If you have the autodidactic mindset, you don't limit your learning to inside a classroom nor do you cling to one teacher. You're a self-directing learner: You take the initiative, setting your own curriculum, your own learning goals and organizing your deliberate practice periods. 

You put in plenty of hours studying alone, expanding your knowledge and skills beyond any structured curriculum offered at a university. You keep going for months and years, not for the sake of a credential, but because you're insatiably curious. Like me 😉


### (2) To Become a Competent Web Developer

> *"Knowledge applied is power; happiness is the feeling of power increasing"*

I aspire to be an individual who has the optimism, competency and confidence to actively shape the world — a playful creator, so to speak. I wish to shape the world as I envision it instead of passively letting the world shape me.

Learning how to code is merely one aspect of my commitmment to learning useful skills

The antidote to feelings of powerlessness is to increase the amount of skills at our disposal. As we increase the amount of skills we have, we increase our power to have an effect on the world. And that potency feels good. Really good.


### (3) To promote myself as the Digital Autodidact

> *"I shall note be satisfied that I have done my best until my name is known from one end of the world to the other"*


### (4) To promote the Strenuous Life Philosophy

> *"I wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life, the life of toil and effort, of labor and strife; to preach that highest form of success which comes, not to the man who desires mere easy peace, but to the man who does not shrink from danger, from hardship, or from bitter toil, and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph."*
