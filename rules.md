# Rules of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge

# Public Commitment
**I, Anthony Avelar, commit myself to completing the #100DaysOfCode Challenge by promising to code for at least 30 minutes every day for the next 100 days!**

### Start Date: February 5, 2025


## My Rules for the Challenge
1. I will code for at least 30 minutes every day for the next 100 days
2. I will write a new log entry every day to provide an update on the day's progress 
3. I will tweet an update about my challenge quest every day on my [Twitter](https://x.com/autodidactdiary) account
4. I will push a commit to my #100DaysOfCode GitHub repo every day (and I'll include a link to that commit in my log entry)
5. I will encourage two other people doing the same challenge on Twitter every day




## Practice Plan
My intent is to work through work through FreeCodeCamp's curriculum courses:
- Responsive Web Design
- JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures
- Frontend Development Libraries
- Relational Databases
- Backend Development and APIs


## Daily Routine
Every day, when I sit down to code, this is the plan I intend to follow:

- Go through FreeCodeCamp exercises (30 minutes)
- Break (5+ minute)
- Do a post-practice review (10 minutes)


### Post-Practice Review Questions

1. What concepts did you learn from your practice session today? 
2. Did you make any mistakes today? If so, are there any lessons you can derive from them?
3. Are there any concepts you feel unsure about? Is there anything you want to research or do more drills on?
4. Did you use any tutorial resources outside of FreeCodeCamp?





## The Ultimate Goal
Build [anthonyavelar.com](https://anthonyavelar.com/) into a portfolio website that has a cool 8-bit RPG videogame aesthetic!

Design the website so that it has these features:
- a splash page with a cool animated message to welcome visitors
- a code projects section
- an art gallery
- a blog section
- a contact form



## Ideas for Chronicling The Challenge Better

- Use these hashtags in your tweets

#100DaysOfCode
#webdevelopment
#learninpublic
#autodidact

- Record yourself while coding with ScreenRec

If you record yourself, you can upload a short clip to Twitter! Just keep in mind, you can only upload a 140 second clip, and it can only be 512MB max!


- Add interesting photos, screenshots and gifs

Make it an entertaining and enjoyable experience for anyone who checks your log. Most challenges logs are text heavy and wordy. Make yours different by breaking up the text with images that show what you're working on. Add screenshots of things such as your actual code, a work in progress, a finished site, and even memes to drive home points. 


- Create an introduction

Make a short and sweet introduction of who you are and what your log is about. Doing this will help the viewer connect with you as a person!


- Include links to live demos

You can use CodePen to create live demos. Take the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code you create and create a new pen to display your work. Then copy the share link of your pen and include it in your log!


- Create and pin a tweet that contains a link to your challenge log

That way, anyone who sees your Twitter page will immediately have a link to your vivid coding journey.
